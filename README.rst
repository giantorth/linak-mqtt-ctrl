==========

Simple python script to control Linak powered desks and USB2LIN06 cable.


Requirements
============

* Linak desk ;)
* USB2LIN06 device
* Python
* `pyusb`_


Usage
=====

.. TBD.


Alternatives
============

There are two projects, which more or less are doing the same. Fist one can be
treated as a reference project - lots of information in the source code, second
one is a python project, which uses `libusb1`_ wrapper library instead of
`pyusb`_:

* `usb2lin06-HID-in-linux-for-LINAK-Desk-Control-Cable`_
* `python-linak-desk-control`_
